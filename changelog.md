- Fixed masonry page content-sidebar overlap
- Removed the "enable the "reply from sideblogs" experiment" feature

The feature was apparently only be enabled on the frontend, and despite this, no errors would be returned by the `/v2/user/reply` requests. Instead, it would post as a reply from the user's main blog if they weren't part of the A/B group, but would still display as a sideblog reply to the person who posted it until the page was refreshed. Why Tumblr handles it like this, who knows.
